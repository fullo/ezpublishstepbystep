    <blockquote>
        <p>"The book is perfect for a developer who is doing his first steps with eZ Publish and
        wants to understand the "nature" of eZ itself. I did read the whole book at once.
        It covers all important thinks like structure, configuration, content classes,
        template-system, extending/overloading of existing stuff, caching ... and has also
        a capital about testing with selenium or server configuration. A perfect start to work with eZ Publish."</p>

        <p>"When I finished reading the book I had the feeling that I needed more to have a better
        understanding of the eZ Publish CMF. I was working with eZ Publish when I started reading
        the book and I found a lot of useful suggestons in it."</p>
